Ever since the times of old  
When he was a boy, a few years old  
The World appeared so dark and oh so cold,  
To this lonely, lost and unguided soul.  

Dropped he was into this mystifying realm  
With no one to tie his shoes but himself  
Ever since he wondered thus,  
"Why am I here, where am I from?"  

But never did the boy get the chance to wonder this wonder so much,  
As his heart was stolen by the beauty of the World in which he was clutched  
And when the thundering storm clouds revealed the sight of the celestial stars swimming through the halo of the brilliant white moon,  
The boy wanted to do nothing more than to give back to the World that gave him so much.
