Lie beneath the soil unturned  
Stories of stars that are yet to be told  
Oh! How I wish to know that  
Exaltation if only I could behold.  

Not just the stories of stars and moons  
But also the secret behind the flower's bloom.  
And darling how I would be thrilled to know  
Why when I dance with you my heart beats hard and my soul swoons?  

I wonder how it would feel to know  
Would I see the colour of your canvas before you move?  
Oh what a silly thought that just can't be  
We are quite the restless kind, aren't we?  

I just feel there is something out there  
If only I knew to search where  
Life seems like an elusive princess leaving a little bread crumb trail  
But the path appears long and hardly fair.  

Sometimes I do wonder what would happen if I reach the end of that road  
Would I attain Nirvana as preached by Buddha's horde?  
Only an idiot would think that's what happiness is  
For I could just kill myself now and have eternal bliss.  

Their mistake and their predecessors' was to assume we know everything   
But darling why close your eyes when the sky is so blue, it's the beginning.
