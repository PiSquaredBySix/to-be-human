What exactly is love? Is it the feeling I experience when I spot someone in the corridor who I think is pretty? Is it the joy I get when I see my pet dog running down the stairs to greet me when I get back home from a long day of coaching? Is it the surreal satisfaction I get in solving a difficult and elegant math problem. Or is it just the current of complex chemical and biological species in our blood stream known as hormones after whose withdrawal we are reminded of how meaningless our lives are?  

Throughout the entire history of our peculiar species, 'love' has time and again emerged to be the greatest motivator for our kind. From the times when an entire war was fought because some dude kidnapped an other guy's wife (somewhat hilariously this turns up multiple times in various epics: Ramayana, Trojan war, padmavat etc.) till the times when Richard Feynman theorized quantum electrodynamics and beyond, people always have and always will be motivated by this 'love' thingy.

But we must stop to understand what exactly this mysterious phenomenon is, that seems to guide everything we do in our lives. It is very hard to follow what you 'love', and make all our life decisions based on it when it behaves like a pesky child.

Conisder for a moment when two unfortunate victims fall start dating because they 'love' each other.
