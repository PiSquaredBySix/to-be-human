This is a short essay on my view on emotions. A lot of what of what is in here makes use of what was written in Purpose (essay). It is a corollary to the theorem if you will.  

As I was saying, it really is an exalting experience when you take in a beautiful piece of art. When it says something that you never thought of, something which is truly ingenious. And when you look at the piece as a whole, and see all the individual components of it working together perfectly, the experience is ecstatic.   

This is what true Happiness is. It is the Happiness you get when you either create or consume a beautiful piece of art. This sort of Happiness — as compared to the Happiness you get when someone complements you for example — is lasting. It stays with you.  

In our day to day lives, we experience many of these superficial emotions. We feel sad, happy, angry often for no good reason which we will realize if we pause and introspect for long enough. These emotions are many of the times due to situations that are out of our control. Well, I guess we are lucky that we live in a Universe where true Happiness depends on factors which are completely in our hands alone!  

I suggest you try this experiment the next time you feel a strong emotion: pause and zoom out on both the spatial and the temporal scale. And on this scale the only things which matter are good explanations, so all these superficial feelings dissolve like fog under the morning sun. After I started doing this exercise, I’ve had many moments where true Happiness would be superposing on a superficial emotion (say sadness). It is a very interesting feeling: I would feel happy and sad at the same time!  

I have only talked about true Happiness above, but true versions of the rest of the standard emotions exist such as true Anger (will be discussed in a future essay) and so on. I will not go into detail here, but you can extend the reasoning I have given for Happiness here.  

I want to leave you with one final thought:  

“Sometimes I just want to sit in a corner all by myself and smile.”  

This happens every time I come across (or remember) a good piece of art (equivalently, any good explanation). I just have to sit and pause to take it all in, although I probably do look like a goofball smiling for no reason if someone sees me when I am doing this. This sentence first occurred to me towards the ending of 2023 and it has stuck with me ever since. If there is one sentence which describes me and everything I stand for, it is probably this.
