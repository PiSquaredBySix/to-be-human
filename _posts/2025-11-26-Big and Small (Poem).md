Then I paused for a moment and turned to the night sky.  
To little white dots resting far above where no bird even dreams to fly.  
They seemed to pierce the void ether with their brilliant white light.  
No wonder the ones who came before us saw them as their ancestors, truly a heavenly sight.  

But now we know they are titans of plasma stretching from end to end,  
For much more distance than our blissfully finite minds can comprehend.  
And I? I am just a little brown speck on a floating blue rock.  
Who am I to stand before them and dictate how they should walk and talk?  

I laughed at our existence standing there before their celestial might,  
What weight have our theories of wrong and right?  
That our abstract philosophical ideas could ever capture them seems a faint possibility,  
To think that our silly little stories have any true meaning, isn’t it vanity?  

What weight indeed have our theories of wrong and right?  
We can’t even seem to agree on a single matter without a fight.  
I laughed as I thought about all the chaos in this world, pandemonium epitome.    
We are monkeys damn it;  
to think that our silly little stories about morality have any true meaning, surely it is insanity?  

So there I stood,  
In a concrete wood,  
Staring forever into the night sky.  
Questioning all ideas of should,  
To have thought we ever could.  
When I saw a plane go by.  

The stars watched its progress as it glided through silent black space.  
As I stood there in the wind lost in wonder before the brilliant blue sky,  
A thought came fluttering to me  

And when I turned back to the plane, all further doubt in my mind erased.  
The plane flew high above where no bird even dreams to fly.  
But we once did, now we do.
