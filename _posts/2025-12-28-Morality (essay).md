“What is the right thing to do?”  

This question is essentially the fundamental question in moral philosophy, and the answers to such questions have been of much interest since the cognitive revolution. As intelligent beings, we really seem to care if we are ‘good’ people.  

Historically, religion played a very important role in moral philosophy. There are sets of rules (usually not precisely defined, they are all loose), which had stories attached explaining why they are as they are. For example, in my culture, it is believed that the goddess of Sin will punish you if you do not wash the heels of your feet!  

A lot of the times, religion does recommend good morals (I’ll give my definition of good morals later) — such as the example I gave above of washing your feet properly. But the problem is, sometimes, morals based on religion leads you very astray (I don’t need to give an example here). This is because religion at its core is based on bad explanations — alchemical explanations. Alchemical explanations (for example the concept of soul) are fundamentally flawed, because they do not describe reality. Therefore, it is obvious that when you use religion as foundation for morality, you will run into trouble.  

So what is the axiom which should form the foundation of moral philosophy? Well since I have already proposed ‘the pursuit of creation of good art’ as the meaning of our lives (see Purpose (essay)), it is clear that the axiom should be  

“The freedom to pursue the creation of art is the most fundamental human right.”  

The story for why this is the axiom is also in Purpose (essay).  

You can see how the Right to Hunger and Right to Shelter are derived from this axiom.  

My suggesting this axiom of course does not solve the entirety of the field of moral philosophy — far from it. But it is the fundamental axiom on which everything else should be based off. Richard Feynman gave a nice analogy: just because we know all the laws of quantum chemistry, doesn’t mean we have solved chemistry. Sure — all phenomenons (even the ones not yet discovered) in chemistry must be explicable by the quantum laws, but just because we know them, it doesn’t mean that we can predict everything that is going to come in the future in chemistry. For example, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) — research on which was awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize — are explained by quantum laws which were formulated by the 1970s at the latest, but to discover them took much longer.  

Similarly, I do not purport to have the solutions to complex moral problems such as war, criminal laws etc. However, the solutions to these problems must not violate the fundamental axiom. That is all I am trying to say.  

Now let us turn to the question of evil. Where does evil come from? What can be considered evil behaviour? I consider evil behaviour to be primarily of three types (all usually accompany each other of course):   

1. Violating the fundamental axiom  
2. Truth as not the top priority   
3. Laziness

1 is pretty self-explanatory. For 2 and 3, consider the following example:  

What goes on in a politician’s head when they engage in corruption? They usually stop caring about the world. They subscribe to flawed perceptions of reality; for example: good and evil always exist, you can’t have a world without evil (Yin-Yang). Another example is the renouncement in the belief of free will and embracing ideas such as Karma. So the politician might argue that they never had the free will to not do corruption! This is what I mean by 2. It is when truth is not a priority in life. When you subscribe to false ideologies of any kind (any bad explanations, religion was only an example) and stay out of touch with reality.  

Now I am not saying that you should never make mistakes. Mistakes always happen; we are human. For example, I was not born with these correct ideas of morality. It is only when I read differing opinions and thought critically for countless hours I arrived at what I believe is the answer. What matters is a thirst for the truth. This is what I had and without which, you will do evil things. I made many mistakes and still do, but I get a better and better understanding of the world after I learn from each one of them.  

Coming back to our case of the politician engaging in corruption, it is possible that the politician already knew what they were doing is wrong. But they still did it because they simply didn’t care. This is what I mean by 3.
