I was recently studying the incredible Theory of Special Relativity, and I realised something while I was staring at the equations. To put it without the mathematics, the distance between two objects in the Earth’s frame is contracted in a frame which is travelling with respect to Earth at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light. This means that, even though the distance between Earth and Alpha Centauri (the nearest star system) is five light years, a journey which even for the fastest entity in the Universe—light itself, in Earth’s frame will take 5 years, a spaceship travelling ridiculously close to the speed of light can make it in just 1 second in its frame! The exact equation is:-

&Delta;t’ = &Delta;x * &radic;(1/v^2 – 1/c^2)

You will see that given any finite &Delta;x value (distance between objects in Earth frame), you can go travel that distance in however short a time you want (&Delta;t'). Consider the implications of this:

In the future, there will come a time when some guy gets into a spaceship on Earth, and reaches Alpha Centauri in a few seconds. INTERSTELLER TRAVEL IS POSSIBLE (hell we can even go out of the observable universe)!

My whole life I’d been thinking that we would forever be doomed to the bounds of our solar system (at best!) because of the sheer scale and massiveness of the Universe. The idea of someone sitting in a spaceship for multiple years (in this case at least 5) just to travel one way out of solar system, didn’t seem practical(this is what would have happened ‘without’ Special Relativity in our Universe). But you don’t have to at all! You can reach any destination of your choice in however small a time —if you have the energy for it!

Now would be the right time share my modification of Murphy’s law: “Anything that can happen, will happen.” (I’m sure some bearded white man must’ve said the exact same thing centuries before me, but I think people have forgotten it these days)

Yes, the energy required is laughably enormous, yes others in the Earth frame will still experience five years go by and yes that means logistics are still an issue if we live lives of eighty years. But the fact is that it still is possible dammit! And everything that can happen will happen.

It is not at all an uncertainty that human life spans will keep increasing on and on, for the better or worse. There will surely come a time when humans will be living longer than a thousand years, be it tomorrow or millenniums later. There will also come a time when humans are able to generate insane amounts of energy. And when that day comes, we will be living among the stars.

It brings me to tears when I think about our seemingly infinite reach (potential) and all the beautiful things we can create and discover. The rockets and structures we will be building, the gadgets and technology we will be using, the places and planets we will be seeing are all not figments of my imagination, but simply our destiny! It seems to me that the mythological characters described in all the holy books are just us from the future. The magical things they could do are not limited to the pages of books, but is a point of time in our future! 

The Universe is very mysterious. Sometimes I am lost in a trance thinking of all the endless possibilities of our future. Will we ever ‘leave’ the Universe? Will we ever meet Aliens or are we special? Will we ever be able to time travel? Will we ever become immortal? And most importantly, we will ever solve philosophy? By the modified Murphy’s law, the answer to all these questions must be yes. Oh and how I wish to be there when all of that happens—but alas I probably won’t live to see it! It has always been a dream of mine to roam the heavens after all.
