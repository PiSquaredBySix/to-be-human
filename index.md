Welcome to my blog 'To be Human'. This blog contains all the stuff I've written over the past 4 years which I think are worth sharing.
Any discussion about these pieces is most welcome, you can reach out to me on the blog [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/project_to_be_human/). This website is still in its very primitive stage &mdash; as stated in the [home](https://pisquaredbysix.github.io/) page, with very boring website design and much fewer pieces than I would've liked to include. However, I will gradually be building up to that.

As my ideas have evolved over the years, it is natural that I do not agree with some of what I had written before. Yet, I have them posted here, as they represent my journey as a human. And that's the point of this website.

At the moment I have not uploaded any essays. I have many more of them than poems. I neeed the time to dig them up. College is demanding... what can I say?
