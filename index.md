Welcome to my blog 'To be Human'. This blog contains all the writing work I have been doing over the years starting from when I was 14, which I think are worth sharing.
Any discussion about these pieces are most welcome, you can reach me out on my [instagram]().

As my ideas have evolved over the years, it is natural that I do not agree with some of what I had written before. Yet, I have them posted here, as they represent my journey as a human. And that's the point of this website.

At the moment I have not uploaded any essays. I have many more of them than poems. I neeed the time to dig them up. College is demanding... what can I say?
